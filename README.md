Funky
=====

With funky I tried to create a "bridge" between Java an any functional programming language. 
The idea: Use the advantages of OOP and FP and keep the languages completely seperated. 
In the current Version one can only use Clojure (which is additionaly needed). You just need to create any class
extending the FunkyBridge and at least the @Funky-Annotation. There are several other annotations available at this point. 
Just check the sources and examples. Currently, the examples are very poor but in the future I plan to publish some real use examples.
Feel free to try it out!
